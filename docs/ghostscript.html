        <h2>Ghostscript</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        Ghostscript is an open source PostScript&#174; and PDF interpreting program. It is used by many vendors for
        printing
        and display. This program uses it to convert from PDfs to a PNG. PNGs are a lossless digital encoding format. A
        shell script (bash) is used to pass parameters to the interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
        The standard command line
        is:<br />gs &ndash;dSAFER &ndash;dBATCH &ndash;dNOPAUSE &ndash;r{dpi} &ndash;dDeskew <nobr>
            &ndash;sDEVICE="{output-file-format}"</nobr>
        <nobr>&ndash;sOutputFile="{output-directory}/page-%03d.png"</nobr>
        <nobr>"{input-file}"</nobr>
    <ul>
        <li>gs - Command for ghostscript program. This must be in your search path.</li>
        <li>SAFER - Use fonts from safe paths for all fonts and files needed by the interpreter. Remove only if you have
            font rendering problems in ghostscript.</li>
        <li>BATCH - Causes Ghostscript to exit after processing all files named on the command line. Don't change.</li>
        <li>NOPAUSE - Disables the prompt and pause at the end of each page. Don't change.</li>
        <li>Deskew - Used with png16m to help deskew images</li>
        <li>-r {dpi} - Parameter is set to how high a DPI you can have. This can be from 150 to 300. At very high
            density, the images may not render in the program (too much memory required). If you don't get images
            rendering, drop the DPI down. The default is 300dpi which is very good quality. 200dpi will usually be good
            enough and will produce files easier to render. 150dpi is the current minimum, but future versions may allow
            lower values, depending upon feedback.</li>
        <li>-sDEVICE={output-file-format} This can be one of several formats:<br />
            <b>At this point, only png formats are supported. Future releases will test and supportall of them.</b> The
            prefered option is png16m but pnggray can be selected to save disk space.
            <ul>
                <li>png16m : 24-bit RGB color PNG</li>
                <li>pnggray : Grayscale PNG</li>
                <li>jpeg : Standard JPEG</li>
                <li>jpeggray : Grayscale JPEG</li>
                <li>bmp16m : 24-bit RGB color bitmap (BMP)</li>
                <li>bmpgray : 'Grayscale bitmap (BMP)</li>
                <li>tiff24nc : '24-bit RGB color TIFF</li>
                <li>tiffgray : Grayscale TIFF</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>-sOutputFile="{output-directory}/page-%03d.{output-type}" The output directory is a combinatio of where
            files are stored, set in Preferences, and the books name that was set in the prompt dialog box. The %03d is
            used by ghostscript to incrment each page as it is processed. The final output type is set to one of the
            supported types: png, tif, jpg, or bmp. You <i>must</i> not change any values in the script.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Errors that may occur</h3>
    <p>
        You've just run the program to convert and a bunch of errors have been thrown up. This is usually because it
        contains non-standard PDF tags or information. You should check the pages have been imported correctly. If they
        haven't, try to open it in a PDF program (e.g. Preview on MacOS) and export the version. This may fix the
        problem.
