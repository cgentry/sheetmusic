    <h2>PDF</h2>
    <p>
        The imput source for music books is PDFs in a standard format. The documents are imported page-by-page into the
        music directory. The standard page format is a PNG, but other formats can be set in the preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently there is no facility to mark up the final pages displayed. If you want to mark them with playing
        notes, you can annotate the original PDFs and reimport the documents into the system.
    </p>
    <a id="import" /> 
    <h2>Import PDFs</h2>
        <p>
            PDF documents must be reformatted for use in the system. The process is to select the file(s) from the system, 
            give them a name and fill any information available, then start the process. The default program used is 
            <a href="https://ghostscript.com">ghostscript</a>,
            which will read each page and write them out to the sheetmusic directory.
            </p>>
            <p>Ghostscript is an open source program that can be installed easily in your system. (Some systems come
                with it on installation.) The SheetMusic program will run a script to convert the PDF and display the progress
                to you. The <a href="ghostscript.html">script can be altered</a>, along with the parameters passed to the program.
                The script that comes with the program has been tested only on a Mac system, but will be tested on additonal 
                systems as it nears completion.

        <h2>Re-Import PDFs</h2>
        <p>
            Once a document has been imported into the system, you can re-import it quite easily. You only need to
            select
            <b>File->Import...->Reimport</b> and select the previously imported document into the system. The previous
            document will be completly deleted but the <a href="bookmarks.html">bookmarks</a> will be re-loaded once the
            process is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            Re-importing a document allows you to mark up the PDF and bring those changes back into the system with very
            little effort.
            If you add pages, however, the bookmarks you set will not be correct. You will need to delete the bookmarks
            that are wrong or
            <a href="bookmarks.html#delete-all">delete all the bookmarks</a> for the book.
        </p>
