# qdb - Database abstraction_ for accessing data in Sqlite3

# Overview
Database access was places here in table-specific classes. This allows better control and testing of
database action_s. In reality, it's more because Sqlite no stored procs and I didn't want to have to
code database accesses over and over. Call me lazy. Call me Ismael.
